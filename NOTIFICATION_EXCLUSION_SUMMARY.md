**Problem**: Admins were receiving notifications about their own actions, causing chat clutter and confusion.

**Solution**: Implemented exclusion logic in all action-specific notification loops to skip sending notifications to the admin who performed the action.

## üéØ Implementation Details

### Notification Types Fixed

#### 1. **Edit Start Notifications** (admin_bot.py:638-641)
```python
for admin_id in Config.ADMIN_CHAT_IDS:
    # Skip notification to the admin who started editing (no self-notification)
    if admin_id == str(admin_user_id):
        continue
```
**Effect**: When admin clicks "‚úèÔ∏è –†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å", only OTHER admins get notified.

#### 2. **Send Message Notifications** (admin_bot.py:786-789)
```python
for admin_id in Config.ADMIN_CHAT_IDS:
    # Skip notification to the admin who sent the message (no self-notification)
    if admin_id == str(query.from_user.id):
        continue
```
**Effect**: When admin clicks "‚úÖ –û—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å", only OTHER admins get notified.

#### 3. **Reject Message Notifications** (admin_bot.py:899-902)
```python
for admin_id in Config.ADMIN_CHAT_IDS:
    # Skip notification to the admin who performed the action (no self-notification)
    if admin_id == str(query.from_user.id):
        continue
```
**Effect**: When admin clicks "‚ùå –û—Ç–∫–ª–æ–Ω–∏—Ç—å", only OTHER admins get notified.

#### 4. **Cancel Edit Notifications** (admin_bot.py:999-1002)
```python
for admin_id in Config.ADMIN_CHAT_IDS:
    # Skip notification to the admin who performed the action (no self-notification)
    if admin_id == str(admin_user_id):
        continue
```
**Effect**: When admin clicks "‚ùå –û—Ç–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—å —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ", only OTHER admins get notified.

#### 5. **Reset Question Notifications** (admin_bot.py:1213-1216)
```python
for admin_id in Config.ADMIN_CHAT_IDS:
    # Skip notification to the admin who performed the action (no self-notification)
    if admin_id == str(admin_user_id):
        continue
```
**Effect**: When admin clicks "üîÑ –°–±—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å", only OTHER admins get notified.

## üéâ Benefits Achieved

### ‚úÖ Reduced Chat Clutter
- Admins no longer receive notifications about their own actions
- Chat conversations are cleaner and more focused
- Only actionable notifications are sent

### ‚úÖ Improved User Experience
- Eliminated confusion about self-notifications
- Reduced notification fatigue for active admins
- Maintained coordination between different admins

### ‚úÖ Maintained System Coordination
- Other admins still receive all necessary notifications
- Multi-admin workflows continue to function correctly
- No loss of important coordination information

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Consistent Pattern Applied
All notification exclusions follow the same pattern:
1. **Identify Action Performer**: Extract admin ID from query or context
2. **Loop Through All Admins**: Iterate through Config.ADMIN_CHAT_IDS
3. **Skip Self-Notification**: Compare admin_id with action performer ID
4. **Continue to Other Admins**: Send notifications to everyone else

### String Conversion Handling
All comparisons use `str()` conversion to ensure consistent type matching:
```python
if admin_id == str(action_performer_id):
    continue
```

### Error Isolation
Notification exclusion logic doesn't affect:
- Main bot functionality
- Message processing
- Error handling
- System reliability

## üß™ Verification

### Manual Testing Confirmed
- ‚úÖ Edit notifications: Action performer excluded
- ‚úÖ Send notifications: Action performer excluded
- ‚úÖ Reject notifications: Action performer excluded
- ‚úÖ Cancel notifications: Action performer excluded
- ‚úÖ Reset notifications: Action performer excluded

### Code Analysis Verified
- 5/5 action-specific notification loops have exclusion logic
- Consistent implementation pattern across all notification types
- Proper string type conversion in all comparisons
- Non-breaking implementation (no disruption to existing functionality)

## üìã User Impact

### Before Fix
```
Admin A clicks "Edit" ‚Üí Admin A receives: "You started editing message X"
Admin A clicks "Send" ‚Üí Admin A receives: "You sent message X"
Admin A clicks "Reject" ‚Üí Admin A receives: "You rejected message X"
```

### After Fix
```
Admin A clicks "Edit" ‚Üí Only Admins B, C, D receive: "Admin A started editing message X"
Admin A clicks "Send" ‚Üí Only Admins B, C, D receive: "Admin A sent message X"
Admin A clicks "Reject" ‚Üí Only Admins B, C, D receive: "Admin A rejected message X"
```

## üöÄ Production Ready

This implementation is:
- **Non-Breaking**: Doesn't affect existing functionality
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with current admin configuration
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal additional processing overhead
- **Maintainable**: Clear, consistent pattern easy to understand and modify
- **Tested**: Verified through manual testing and code analysis

**Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED AND READY FOR PRODUCTION USE

The notification spam issue has been completely resolved while maintaining all necessary coordination functionality between administrators.
